## Introduction
Humans have credited tongue analysis for health diagnosis in the eastern medicine for long time. With recent advances in computing, we can make computers as intelligent, automating the traditional methods.

Challenge: Design a model that estimates key tongue
features from images and translates them into holistic health scores.

## Objective 
Develop an AI powered computer vision system that automatically analyzes tongue images
Extract five key diagnostic features: coating, jaggedness, cracks, filiform papillae size, and fungiform papillae redness
Compute two holistic health indicators:

                1. Nutrition Score: Reflecting dietary balance and nutrient status
                2. Mantle Score: Indicating immune strength and protective energy
